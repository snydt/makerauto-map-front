# Maker Auto Map web/mobile app

**History of the project**
see the API maker auto map [README](https://github.com/laudeon/makerauto-map-api/blob/master/README.md)

**The project is not production-ready yet. It is a prototype, it can have some specific (non generic) parts, for example, url, magic numbers, etc.**

## Requirements

There is no requirements since it is a front-end web project (HTML, CSS, JS). So, a web browser can run the entire project.

But, we host this project for the exhibetion on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). That is why there is an `index.php` file in the project.

Also, we made a mobile app of this project with apache cordova (see [documentation](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/overview/index.html)).

## Getting started

**clone the project with git**
`git clone https://github.com/snydt/makerauto-map-front.git`

**open index.html in your web browser**
